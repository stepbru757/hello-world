A bit about me

I'm totally new to coding, or anthing other than using a pre-existing program. It's intimidating, but fun too.
I work in higher education and head a new initiative on campus to document, explore, and use the various data sources at our disposal for business decisions. My role grew largely out of my work to help promote standardized reports and the data standards associated with those reports. I love the story that unfolds in an examination of data, but the key is starting with good data. To make a huge leap forward in my abilities in this area, I'll attend a data science bootcamp in June, and using git is part of my prep.

A whole new world...
